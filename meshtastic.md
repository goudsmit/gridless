# meshtastic radio-based mesh messaging

In case mobile and fixed internet drop away, there is no way to reach relatives or friends to check in on them.

Meshtastic is an open source project, with open source hardware, to setup a mesh network of small radio-based devices,
that require little power, and can send text-messages between them. The system supported end to end encryption, private
messages, group chats via 'channels', and can easily stay charged with a small solar panel.
